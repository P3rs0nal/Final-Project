                    Mixing and mastering are used to make minor changes to songs to ensure they sound clean and polished.
                    Mixing involves balancing invidual tracks, volume levels, and applying effects to certain sounds. These changes
                    help integrate all the sounds together so they sound coherent.

                    Mstering is the final step, where the mixed track is optimized for various devices and platforms. This includes adjusting
                    overall loudness, stero width, and even ensuring that the song fits across the theme of album.
